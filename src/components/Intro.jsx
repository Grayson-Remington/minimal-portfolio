          My journey started back in my highschool drafting class, where my passion for solving problems was
             ignited by learning Autodesk software. I spent 3 years working with AutoCAD and Inventor before heading to 
             Colorado State to study Mechanical Engineering. While at Colorado State, I worked at the university recreation center.
              For 5 years, I honed my customer service and communication skills. After graduating, I joined a telecommunications
               engineering company and was able to use both my communication and problem solving/design skills to build construction 
               drawings for telecom companies. The only aspect of my job that I did not find desirable was the daily driving to 
               sites all around Virginia. Web development is perfect for me as it allows me to continue using the problem solving 
               and communication skills that I developed over the years, from a stable location.
